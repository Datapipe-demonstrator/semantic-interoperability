# Ontologies used

All the industry-specific ontologies are aligned to the FEDeRATED upper ontology. More resources on the FEDeRATED semantic model can be found at the developer portal of the [FEDeRATED project](https://federatedplatforms.eu/index.php/products/developer-portal/documentation) and in the GitHub repository [FEDeRATED GitHub](https://github.com/Federated-BDI/FEDeRATED-Semantic-Model)
## Automotive industry
The ontology used for automobiles has been developed by EDM Council, and can be found [here](https://github.com/edmcouncil/auto/tree/master).
## Electric batteries industry
The ontology used for electric batteries is an RDF interpretation of the [CatenaX Battery Pass 3.0.1 Aspect Meta Model](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.battery.battery_pass/3.0.1). The RDF interpretation has been achieved through manual conversion. The pseudocode algorithm can be found at [CatenaX-interpretation](./CatenaX%20ontology%20and%20alignment/README.md).
## Electronics
The ontology used for electronics has been developed by Anelia Kurteva at TU Delft and can be found [here](https://github.com/RePlanIT/Ontology).
