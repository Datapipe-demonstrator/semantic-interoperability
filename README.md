This repository is part of the [Datapipe research project](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/onderzoek/projecten/datapipe-project), which aims to help the Customs Administration of the Netherlands and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands to be better equipped to meet their responsibilities in the context of the circular economy. The project will deliver a diagnostic problem analysis report, blueprint for piloting, and recommendations.
# Ontologies included

More information on the semantic models used in this demo can be found at [Ontologies page](./Ontologies/README.md)

# Demo environment to test semantic interoperability
In the Datapipe research project we have set up a network of [FEDeRATED nodes](https://github.com/Federated-BDI/Docker-BDI-Node/tree/main) to highlight how message models created from semantic models interconnected through the upper ontology and the industry-specific alignments can be transmitted between multiple parties in a decentralized manner.

We have constructed the message models using [Semantic Treehouse](https://service-registry.federatedplatforms.eu/#/).

# Application Profile example For the UN Recommendation 46

In the Datapipe research project we have created an [Application Profile] (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/application-profiles-what-are-they-and-how-model-and-reuse-them-properly-look-through-dcat-ap) considering the Core Vocabulary as the union of the FEDeRATED upper ontology, the industry-specific ontologies and their alignments. For each [UN Recommendation 46](https://unece.org/trade/publications/recommendation-no46-enhancing-traceability-and-transparency-sustainable-value traceability category of data fields we have produced a separate file with example data and a SPARQL query, expressed using the semantic models contained in this repository.
