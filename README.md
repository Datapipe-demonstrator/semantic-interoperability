This repository is part of the [Datapipe research project](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/onderzoek/projecten/datapipe-project), which aims to help the Customs Administration of the Netherlands and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands to be better equipped to meet their responsibilities in the context of the circular economy. The project will deliver a diagnostic problem analysis report, blueprint for piloting, and recommendations.

# Semantic Interoperability and Application Profiles

In the Datapipe research project we have created 2 [Application Profiles](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/application-profiles-what-are-they-and-how-model-and-reuse-them-properly-look-through-dcat-ap), to highlight the flexibility of a unified semantic approach based on a set of generic and industry specific ontologies that are customized to the needs of a use case through means of semantic connections. 

The Application Profiles have been created based on the definition given by the European Comission through the Interoperable Europe SEMIC Support Centre:
1. considering the Core Vocabulary as the union of the [FEDeRATED upper ontology, the industry-specific ontologies and their alignment](./Ontologies/README.md)
2. for each use case identify the concepts not covered by the upper and aligned ontologies
3. design the Application Profile as an RDF/OWL file, referencing within the file to the existing ontologies

## Application Profile for EV Battery compliance check by authorities

The Application Profile we have created for this use case can be found [here](./Technical%20resources/Application%20Profile%20example.ttl). Using this Application Profile, we have answered to the [authorities queries](./Authority%20Standardized%20Query%20Example.md).

## Application Profile for UN Recommendation 46

We have interpreted the definition and created our [UN Recommendation 46](https://unece.org/trade/publications/recommendation-no46-enhancing-traceability-and-transparency-sustainable-value) Application Profile . We have created the Application Profile to cover all the traceability properties found in the [product information](./UNR46%20queries/product-information.md) category. We have produced a separate file with example data and a SPARQL query, expressed using the Application Profile contained in this repository.

# Blueprint for piloting

We have created a blueprint for any company to follow, should they want to join the semantic data sharing network. The whitepaper detailing every step of the blueprint can be found at: [10.13140/RG.2.2.34052.74885](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383659169_Government_Accessing_Business_Data_for_Compliance_Monitoring_of_Circular_Economy_DATAPIPE_White_paper?channel=doi&linkId=66d59bbdfa5e11512c47cd97&showFulltext=true). In the table below we focus on the technical steps (mainly Step 2), providing aiding resources in understanding the technical implementation.
