This repository is part of the [Datapipe research project](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/onderzoek/projecten/datapipe-project), which aims to help the Customs Administration of the Netherlands and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands to be better equipped to meet their responsibilities in the context of the circular economy. The project will deliver a diagnostic problem analysis report, blueprint for piloting, and recommendations.
# Ontologies included
All the industry-specific ontologies are aligned to the FEDeRATED upper ontology. More resources on the FEDeRATED semantic model can be found at [FEDeRATED](https://github.com/Federated-BDI/FEDeRATED-Semantic-Model) and about the [FEDeRATED project](https://federatedplatforms.eu/) in general.
## Automotive industry
The ontology used for automobiles has been developed by EDM Council, and can be found [here](https://github.com/edmcouncil/auto/tree/master).
## Electric batteries industry
The ontology used for electric batteries is an RDF interpretation of the [CatenaX Battery Pass 3.0.1 Aspect Meta Model](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.battery.battery_pass/3.0.1).

Additionally, a helping ontology developed by TNO is also provided, so all the fields of the attribute longlist document from [Battery Pass](https://thebatterypass.eu/) are covered.
## Electronics
The ontology used for electronics has been developed by Anelia Kurteva at TU Delft and can be found [here](https://github.com/RePlanIT/Ontology).
